# Create / Update Form

A common pattern in CRUD applications is to reuse the same components for creating and editing an entity. This state machine handles both cases, including data fetching (when in update mode), validating the inputs and calling the correct create/edit method when submitting.

<WholeContext />

## Checking if in edit mode

We start out in a transitory state of <State>checkingIfInEditMode</State>. This makes a synchronous check to <Context stringify>isInEditMode</Context> in context. For the purposes of this demonstration, I've made this value randomly pick between true or false. Refresh the page to try it.

If we _are_ in edit mode, we head to <State>fetchingItemToEdit</State>. If not, we go straight to the <State>awaitingSubmit</State> state.

## Fetching the item

When we're in edit mode, we need to make an async call to the database to grab the item we need to edit. That's what the <State>fetchingItemToEdit</State> state is for.

If the item is successfully fetched, the <Service>fetchItem</Service> service sends back the <Event>SUCCESSFULLY_FETCHED_ITEM</Event> event. That then gets saved into context under <Context stringify>itemToProcess</Context>, and we're ready to go to <State>awaitingSubmit</State>.

If the fetch fails, the service sends back <Event>error.platform.fetchItem</Event>, which saves an <Context>errorMessage</Context> into context. The user can then <Event>RETRY</Event> if they like.

## Submitting the form

In the <State>awaitingSubmit</State> state, the user can <Event>SUBMIT</Event> the form. We head to either <State>submitting.editing</State> or <State>submitting.creating</State> depending on whether <Context stringify>isInEditMode</Context> is `true`.

- If the operation goes wrong, via <Event>error.platform.editItem</Event> or <Event>error.platform.createItem</Event>, we head back to <State>awaitingSubmit</State> with the <Context>errorMessage</Context> saved.

- If the operation goes well, via <Event>done.invoke.editItem</Event> or <Event>done.invoke.createItem</Event>, we're done! We head to the <State>complete</State> state and either <Action>onCreateSuccess</Action> or <Action>onEditSuccess</Action> are fired.
