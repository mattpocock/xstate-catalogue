# Multi Step Form With Validation

This expands on the other [multi-step form](/machines/multi-step-form) example. If you haven't already, read that machine first.

This one gets a lot more complex by adding some crucial logic - asynchronous validation to each step.

## Validation pattern

Each page now follows a similar pattern. Let's take <State>enteringBeneficiary</State> as an example. On <Event>CONFIRM_BENEFICIARY</Event>, we enter the <State>enteringBeneficiary.submitting</State> state.

If the beneficiary fails validation, we receive <Event>error.platform.validateBeneficiary</Event>, which saves the <Context>errorMessage</Context>.

But if it passes with <Event>done.invoke.validateBeneficiary</Event>, we head to <State>enteringBeneficiary.complete</State>. This is the final state of <State>enteringBeneficiary</State> - that triggers <Event>done.state.enteringBeneficiary</Event>, sending us to <State>enteringDate</State>.

## Second Validation pattern

This pattern repeats itself in <State>enteringDate</State>. I'll express it in diagram form here for brevity.

<p>
  <Event>CONFIRM_DATE</Event> ->{" "}
  <State>enteringDate.submitting</State>
</p>

<p>
  <Event>done.invoke.validateDate</Event> ->{" "}
  <State>enteringDate.complete</State> -> <State>confirming</State>
</p>

## Confirming

Finally, we're in the confirmation stage, which plays out exactly the same as [the other example](/machines/multi-step-form).
