# Data Fetch With Local Cache

## Filling up the cache

We start in the <State>idle</State> state. The first time that <Event>FETCH</Event> is called, we head to <State>fetching</State> with the <Context stringify>currentVariablesBeingProcessed</Context> value populated in context.

From there, we can receive a <Event>RECEIVE_DATA</Event> event which pulls in the value into the cache. That takes us back to <State>idle</State>.

<WholeContext />

## Fetching a cached item

If the item is already in the cache when the user presses <Event>FETCH</Event>, we return to the <State>idle</State> state. The items are cached, so can be retrieved by stringifying the <Context stringify>currentVariablesBeingProcessed</Context> value.
