# Locales

This machine handles the entire state of localization in an app. It stores all locales, current locale and the current set of strings.

## States -> idle

The initial state. Nothing insteresting happens here. üëª

### Events -> START

The event <Event>START</Event> starts the machine. In this event, you can send defaults locales and default language (locale whitout {s}).

### Actions-assignLocales

The action <Action>assignLocales</Action> is responsible to assign the locales coming from event to the machine's context.

## State -> started

Where good things happen. üòΩ

### State -> changing

Transient state <State>changing</State>, which handles the switch of languages/locales.
Actions: Change the current set of strings.

### State -> normal

State <State>normal</State> is the main state of the machine. Here you can send event to change the current locale, which triggers the switch of the set of strings.

Event: <Event>CHANGE_LANGUAGE</Event>, where you can send the language code that ou want (It must be existed inside the whole locales).
Action: <Action>changeLocale</Action>, changes the current locale.

## NB

This code can be used as spawned machine (inside another machine), simple machine or as a service inside an async state node. ü§õüèæ
The action <Action>updateParent</Action> was commented because it creates a bug when you execute inside the inspector.
