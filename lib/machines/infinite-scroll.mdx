# Infinite Scroll

Infinite scroll has become a staple of the social media feed, and it's an important tool to have in your kit as an alternative to [button-based pagination](/machines/pagination).

## Fetching the initial data

We start in <State>fetchingRowOfData</State>, which fires off the <Service>fetchRowOfData</Service> service. When the <Event>RECEIVED_DATA</Event> event is fired, we end up in <State>idle</State>, with the new data available in our context.

<WholeContext />

## Managing the Scroll

When in <State>idle</State>, the user scrolls to the end of the page, we fire the <Event>SCROLL_TO_BOTTOM</Event> event, the machine goes back to <State>fetchingRowOfData</State> to grab more data to fill the space.

## Reaching the end

When there's no more data to receive, we end up in the <State>noMoreDataToFetch</State> state. The machine knows that via a quick round trip to the <State>checkingIfThereIsMoreData</State> state, which runs the <Action>thereIsMoreData</Action> guard to check whether or not to head to <State>noMoreDataToFetch</State>

## Error handling

If, when in the <State>fetchingRowOfData</State> state, the <Service>fetchRowOfData</Service> service fails, <Event>error.platform.fetchRowOfData</Event> is called. That sends us back to <State>idle</State> with the <Context>errorMessage</Context> filled in.
