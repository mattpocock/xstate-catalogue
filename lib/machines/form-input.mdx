# Form Input

This machine handles the entire state of a single form input. It's surprisingly complex. No wonder folks build form libraries to handle this stuff.

## Enabled / Disabled

At the top level sits the <State>active</State> and <State>disabled</State> states. They can be switched between via the <Event>ENABLE</Event> and <Event>DISABLE</Event> events.

When you're in the <State>disabled</State> state, most of the events won't work any more.

## Focused / Blurred

When you're in the <State>active</State> state, the focused/blurred functionality comes to life.

The <State>active.focus.focused</State> and <State>active.focus.unfocused</State> states can be toggled between via the <Event>BLUR</Event> and <Event>FOCUS</Event> events.

## Async Validation

Finally, you can manage validation via the <Service>validateField</Service> service.

The machine starts by validating the field initially in the <State>active.validation.pending</State> state. If, while pending, the machine receives a <Event>REPORT_INVALID</Event> event, we'll go to <State>active.validation.invalid</State>.

If <Service>validateField</Service> finishes without receiving an error, <Event>done.invoke.validateField</Event> will trigger and target the <State>active.validation.valid</State> state.

Any <Event>CHANGE</Event> events that trigger will kick off the async validation again, heading to <State>active.validation.pending</State>.
