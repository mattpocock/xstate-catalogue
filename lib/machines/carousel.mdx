# Carousel

A carousel can be used for a variety of purposes. It can be used to display a set of images, content, or both.
This machine handles the transitions between the slides in the carousel.

## States

This carousel machine has the following states:

<State>idle</State><br/>
<State>playing</State><br/>
<State>paused</State><br/>

## Transitions

The <State>idle</State> state would be your standard user controlled carousel. Think of an image carousel with navigation buttons or pagination buttons.

From the <State>idle</State> state we can transition to the <State>playing</State> state by raising the <Event>AUTO_PLAY</Event> event, 
which will cause the carousel to begin <State>playing</State> and will update the active index 
at the interval provided, this is handled by the service <Service>autoUpdateActiveIndex</Service>. 
From this point we can do three things:

 1. send the <Event>PAUSE</Event> event to pause the carousel.
 2. send the <Event>RESET</Event> event to reset back to active index 0, transitioning to the <State>idle</State> state.
 3. send the <Event index={4}>UPDATE_INDEX</Event> event with an index to move to a custom slide index (useful for paginated carousels) but
 remaining in the <State>playing</State> state.

From the <State>paused</State> state we can resume <State>playing</State> from the index we paused at by sending the <Event>AUTO_PLAY</Event> event, send 
the <Event>RESET</Event> event to reset to active index 0 and transition into the <State>idle</State> state 
or send the <Event index={3}>UPDATE_INDEX</Event> event with a custom index to remain <State>paused</State> which could allow the carousel 
to resume <State>playing</State> from an alternative index like so:

```javascript
send({ type: "UPDATE_INDEX", index: 4 });
```
