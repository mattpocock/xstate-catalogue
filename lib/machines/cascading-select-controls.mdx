# Cascading Select Controls

It is common to have a form with a set of select controls where one selection drives the values in the following select.
If the first selection is changed, the following select controls are reset/disabled.

## The pattern

When the machine is started it is in the <State>awaitingFirstSelection</State> state. When the user selects a value the <Event value={1}>FIRST_SELECTED</Event> event
is triggered with the selected value. This sets the selection in the context
and the options for the second select are loaded. This completes with <Event values={[4,5,6]}>SECOND_OPTIONS_LOADED</Event>
 and the machine enters <State>firstSelected.awaitingSecondSelection</State>. The pattern is repeated to an arbitrary depth.

When the machine is in <State>firstSelected.awaitingSecondSelection</State> it will respond to either another <Event value={2}>FIRST_SELECTED</Event>,
which will trigger another request to load the second set of options, or the user may make a selection from the second
control triggering <Event value={4}>SECOND_SELECTED</Event>. As above this updates the context and also triggers
the load of the third set of options. This completes with <Event values={[7, 8, 9]}>THIRD_OPTIONS_LOADED</Event> and moves the machine to <State>firstSelected.secondSelected.awaitingThirdSelection</State>.

Again, the machine will respond to selections in previous controls (<Event data={{value: 1}}>FIRST_SELECTED</Event> or <Event value={6}>SECOND_SELECTED</Event>).
It will also respond to <Event value={9}>THIRD_SELECTED</Event> which is the final selection in this machine and
moves the machine to <State>firstSelected.secondSelected.thirdSelected</State>.
