# Deduplication

Deduplication is similar to [debouncing](/machines/debounce), but instead of restarting the timer on every new event, the machine promises to only fire the event at an interval you set.

## Kicking off the dedup

We start in the <State>canPerformAction</State> state, and pressing <Event>Go</Event> will immediately fire an `alert('Action fired!')`.

We then head to the <State>deduplicating</State> state, where <Event>Go</Event> no longer works for a couple of seconds. This means that no matter how many times the <Event>Go</Event> event is fired, it will only execute at most every 2 seconds.
