# Simple Data Fetch

There are tons of patterns for fetching data from a remove server, but let's focus on the simplest.

## Playing fetch

We start with a <Event>FETCH</Event> event, which takes us from the <State>idle.noError</State> state into <State>fetching</State>.

From there, we're waiting for a <Event>RECEIVE_DATA</Event> event, which saves the data into context under <Context stringify>data</Context>.

If the <Service>fetchData</Service> service fails, we'll get an <Event>error.platform.fetchData</Event> event.

If that happens, we save the error into context under <Context>errorMessage</Context> and head to the <State>idle.errored</State> state.

## Cancelling and refetching

If a <Event>FETCH</Event> happens while we're in the <State>fetching</State> state, the service is re-triggered with the new variables passed in to <Event>FETCH</Event>. This means if you're using an [invoked callback](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/communication.html#invoking-callbacks) to represent your <Service>fetchData</Service> service, you can implement cancelling the current fetch call.

You can also fire a <Event>CANCEL</Event> event while in <State>fetching</State>, which will end the current <Service>fetchData</Service> service and take you back to <State>idle.noError</State>.
