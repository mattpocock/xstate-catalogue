# Debounce

Debouncing is a handy tool for lightening the load on heavy tasks. If you have a search box that you want to use for filtering on the server, debouncing will help you deduplicate multiple calls.

Debouncing can be troublesome to implement in vanilla Javascript, but state machines make them quite trivial.

## Pressing Go

We start off in the <State>idle</State> state. Pressing <Event>GO</Event> will send us into <State>debouncing</State>.

From there, we have a countdown of two seconds before the action we passed into the event is fired. Which in this case, is `alert('Action fired!')`.

But if we press <Event>GO</Event> multiple times, we stay in <State>debouncing</State> longer than two seconds, and only the _last_ action we passed in gets fired.
