# Simple Drag and Drop

## Picking things up

When a user picks up an item, via <Event index={1}>PICK_UP</Event>, we enter the <State>dragging</State> state. The item they pick up is saved in context under <Context stringify>itemBeingHeld</Context>.

When the dragged item reaches the intersection of another item (i.e. is dragged over it) we call the <Event index={2}>DRAG_REACHED_INTERSECTION</Event> event, which assigns the new intersection to context under <Context stringify>itemBeingHeld</Context>.

When the user drops the item, via <Event>DROP</Event>, the list is rearranged and assigned into context.

<WholeContext />

## Test cases

### Swapping items 1 and 2

Pick up first item: <Event index={0}>PICK_UP</Event>.

Cross over second item: <Event index={1}>DRAG_REACHED_INTERSECTION</Event>.

Drop item: <Event>DROP</Event>.

Numbers one and two of the data list should have swapped places.

### Swapping items 1 and 3

Pick up first item: <Event index={0}>PICK_UP</Event>.

Cross over third item: <Event index={3}>DRAG_REACHED_INTERSECTION</Event>.

Drop item: <Event>DROP</Event>.

The first item should now be at the end.
