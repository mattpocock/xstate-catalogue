# Pagination

This machine handles button-based pagination, for instance paginating a tabular dataset. It's a little different to [infinite scroll](/machines/infinite-scroll).

## Total Pages

This machine relies on receiving <Event totalPages={20}>UPDATE_TOTAL_PAGES</Event> in order to work out how it should behave. Once it does, it moves from the <State>awaitingTotalPages</State> state to the <State>idle</State> state. It also updates <Context>totalPages</Context> in context.

<WholeContext />

## Current Page

Once we're in the <State>idle</State> state, the <Context>currentPage</Context> value starts to matter.

- <Event>PREV_PAGE</Event> takes us to the previous page, if valid.
- <Event>NEXT_PAGE</Event> takes us to the next page, if valid.
- <Event targetPage={10}>GO_TO_TARGET_PAGE</Event> takes us to a target page, if
  it's within bounds. I've configured that button to always go to page 10.

## Handling Total Pages updates

Sometimes, the number of <Context>totalPages</Context> may change based on external factors, such as filters applied to the search results. When this happens, we need to check that the <Context>currentPage</Context> is still within bounds.

For instance, if we <Event targetPage={19}>GO_TO_TARGET_PAGE</Event> of 19, and then <Event totalPages={5}>UPDATE_TOTAL_PAGES</Event> of 5, the <Context>currentPage</Context> will be reverted to the first page so it doesn't end up being out of bounds.
